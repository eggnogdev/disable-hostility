# Disable Hostility

minecraft mod to disable hostility of mobs towards players on a per player basis

## download

download via [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/disable-hostility) or check the [releases](https://github.com/Daniel-Egorov/disable-hostility/releases)

## How to use in game

(only players with permission level 4 can run the command)

run this command: /hostility disable {player_name}
re-enable it with: /hostility enable {player_name}

## Why use this mod?

I made this for the rare scenario that you would like to play survival minecraft NOT in peaceful mode, but another player that you play with would like the tranquility of peaceful mode. So just disable hostility for them, and you'll still have monsters that will target you.

## Support the project

even a simple download is enough to show support, but if you're feeling generous you can [buy me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/egorov)
